Leaflet plugins for producing data URLs of canvas layers.

Build Instructions:
===================

Copy the three files (and directories if needed) in here:

- build/deps.js;
- src/layer/tile/dataurl/TileLayer.Canvas.toDataURL.js
- src/map/compositer/Map.Compositer.js;

to the corresponding places in a Leaflet repository and build.

Usage:
======

The dataurl extension of TileLayer.Canvas brings two new methods to 
TileLayer.Canvas:

toViewportCanvas(format) - returns a new canvas covering the visible area
of a canvas layer.

toDataURL(format) - returns a data URL of an image in the given format
showing the visible area.

The compositer extension to the Map class combines all canvas layers to
give one composite image. it provides one new method in Map:

compositeCanvases(format) - returns a data URL containing a composite of
all canvas layers, covering the currently visible area.`
